# Installing Python

Lab exercises will introduce programming for signal processing using Python. It will help to know C and Octave/MATLAB from the Signals and Systems course, as a prerequisite.

Most systems have Python installed. We can check this in the terminal using `python --version` We should see the installed Python version, or otherwise see an error message. If Python is not installed download and install the latest version from [Python/Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

If the installation is successful, use your favourite text editor, or IDE to write a "Hello World" script.

```python
print("Hello World!")
```
